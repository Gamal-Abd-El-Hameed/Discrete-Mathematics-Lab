## 1. Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
Implement sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.

## 2. Trial Division algorithm
Implement Trial Division algorithm for integer factorization.

## 3. Extended Euclidean algorithm
Implement the extended Euclidean algorithm that finds the greatest common divisor d of two positive integers a and b. In addition, it outputs Bezout’s coefficients s and t such that: d = s * a + t * b

## 4. Chinese Remainder theorem
Implement Chinese remainder theorem that takes as input m<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>2</sub>, m<sub>3</sub>, ...., m<sub>n</sub> that are pairwise relatively prime and (a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ...., a<sub>n</sub>) and calculates x such that:<br>
x = a<sub>1</sub> (mod m<sub>1</sub>)<br>
x = a<sub>2</sub> (mod m<sub>2</sub>)<br>
...<br>
x= a<sub>n</sub> (mod m<sub>n</sub>)

## 5. Miller’s Test
Implement Miller’s test (a probabilistic primality test).
